# 3D-SemiDeformable-ObjectTracking


This repository contains a suite of programs meant to aid in the detection of semi-deformable objects. The object used in this repository consisted of a bell pepper. It was used to develop my Master's Thesis. 

## Python requirements

The code in general was developed in a Windows 11 machine. It was developed using the Anaconda python distribution. An Anaconda virtual environment with Python 3.10.13 was used. A requirements.txt file is included in order to allow for a recreation of the environment used for the development of this code.
